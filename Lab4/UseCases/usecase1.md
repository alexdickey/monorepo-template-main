# Use Case 1
# The window and drawable canvas should be 600x400 (600 pixels wide, 400 pixels high)

<hr>

**Use Case**: Window/Canvas Sizing

**Primary Actor**: System

**Goal in Context**: To ensure the window and canvas are of proper dimensions

**Preconditions**: The program must be able to be launched into a visible state

**Trigger**: Opening the program
  
**Scenario**: Upon opening the program, the window will appear on the users screen with the proper dimensions
 
**Exceptions**: The program may not open or may be slow to open, in this event - restarting the machine or redownloading the program to update the most recent software should ammend

**Priority**: Medium-Priority

**When available**: First Release

**Channel to actor**: The system is responsible for the display of the window of a correct size. The window should appear when the user launches the application

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: If the user decides to resize their window, we may need to implement a way to save the size that they prefer as opposed to relaunching at the default 600x400
